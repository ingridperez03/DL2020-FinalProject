## Problem Description 

Sentiment analysis is the problem of analysing text data in order to identify and categorise opinions in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a topic is positive, neutral and negative. Similar to Sentiment analysis, there is Emotional analysis which aims to detect and recognise feelings through the expressions of texts, such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.

The aim is to create a recurrent neural network to solve the sentiment analysis problem using a dataset that contains tweets labelled as either positive, neutral, or negative. Once the model has been trained, the aim is to adapt the architecture of the recurrent neural network so that it performs accurately the task of emotion analysis on another dataset of tweets.
